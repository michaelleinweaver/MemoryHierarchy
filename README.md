This project is an investigation into the effectiveness and shortcomings of the memory hierarchy on processor architectures.

The specification of the project is as follows:

- [X] 32 Bit Von Neumann Architecture
- [X] Multi-Cycle CPU
  - [X] Datapath
  - [X] CPU Controller
- [X] Memory Components:
  - [X] Memory Controller
  - [X] Memory Management Unit
  - [X] Translation Lookaside Buffer
  - [X] L2 Cache (512 Bytes, 16 x 8 words)
  - [X] Main Memory (4096 Bytes, 128 x 8 words)
  - [X] I/O Buffer (4096 Bytes, 128 x 8 words)
  - [X] Magnetic Disk (4 Gigabytes, 1048576 x 8 words)
